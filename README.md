# Encoding

## About
 - This is a simple library in C just in case someone wants to do some encoding for some reason.
 - You can copy the source code for whatever you want; you don't have to give any credit because this is very simple.

## Included features
 - There are hex encoding and decoding functions (`hex_encode` and `hex_decode`).
 - There are URL "encoding" and "decoding" functions (`url_encode` and `url_decode`). Also, I put the quotation marks because I don't know if it's really considered encoding.
 - A simple function for reading files (`read_file`).
